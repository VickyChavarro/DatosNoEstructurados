- The aim was to analyse the cultural perceptions and influences of these public figures using advanced text processing techniques. The data came from Wikipedia entries, and the preparation process included cleaning the text and creating numerical representations using TF-IDF and embeddings. These techniques capture the importance and semantic context of words, facilitating the analysis of relationships between artists.

- For modelling, we applied t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), a dimensionality reduction technique that helps to visualise complex relationships in textual data in a two or three dimensional space. This representation allowed us to identify clusters and patterns in the artists' textual descriptions, revealing cultural and professional connections, as well as highlighting unique characters or outliers in the dataset.
